From the note opa_v.3.37.pdf, written by A. Streun - Feb. 21th, 2012 :

"OPA's main purpose is to support the development of electron (positron) storage rings. Emphasis
is on visualization and interactivity. OPA is in particular useful for designing high
brightness light source lattices, but may be used for transfer lines and other types of lattices
as well. Storage ring design with OPA starts from scratch and ends at a bare (i.e. error free)
lattice with optimized 2D dynamic apertures, to be passed on to other codes like TRACY or
MAD, which use more complete models."
